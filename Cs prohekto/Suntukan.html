<h2>Suntukan</h2>

<p>Suntukan, or Panantukan, is the FMA version of western boxing. But it is not to be confused with it because Suntukan is not only limited to punches, it has grappling 
    and kicking martial arts incorported in it such as Sikaran and Dumog. Although it's original name is Suntukan, term used to denote the martial is 'Panuntukan' 
    as the term 'suntukan' is now synonymous with brawls. It is also known as 'Dirty Boxing'
</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The term suntukan comes from the Tagalog word for punch, suntok. It is the Filipino term for a fistfight, brawl, or boxing.
    There is no known origin aside from the name.
</p> 
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p> Suntukan is not a sport, but rather a street-oriented fighting system. The techniques have not been adapted for safety or 
  conformance to a set of rules for competition, thus it has a reputation as "dirty street fighting". It mainly consists of upper-body striking techniques such as punches, elbows, headbutts, shoulder strikes and limb destruction. 
  It is often used in combination with Sikaran, the kicking aspect of Filipino fighting which includes low-line kicks, tripping and knee strikes to the legs, shins, and groin. Many of its other unique movesets include elbow blocks, 
  bolo punches and other chopping strikes, evasive maneuvers, and parrying stances.
  Suntukan practitioners typically circle constantly to avoid getting hit and look for openings, just like with knife fighting. 
  According to Filipino martial artist Lucky Lucaylucay: "...if your practice is based on knife fighting, you have to become much more sophisticated with your footwork, evasions and delivery because one wrong move could mean death... 
  ...Filipino boxing is exactly like knife fighting, except instead of cutting with a blade, we strike with a closed fist."
</p>
<p>Weaponry is also used in Suntukan despite it's designed against armed and unarmed confrontation. Weapons used are knives, palmsticks, and icepicks.
  These weapons do not hinder the execution of teachniques as they small and can be easily concealed. As such, suntukan want you to have minimized contact 
  with the enemy as they might have concealed weapons in their fists. Thus, parrying and evading is better thatn blocking in Suntukan.
