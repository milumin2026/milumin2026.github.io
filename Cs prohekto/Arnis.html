<h2>Kali Arnis</h2>
<p>Kali Arnis, also known as Eskrima, is a a martial arts from Philippines that focus in weapon 
    fighting using blunt, improvised and bladed weapons such as sticks, machetes, knives, and batons. This is also the Philippines
national martial art and is the first martial art observed in the Philippines. The martial art also includes other techniques such as 
hand-to-hand combat, joint-locks, grappling, and disarment</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The word Kali comes from the pre-Hispanic word 'Kalis' meaning blades. The word Arnis comes from the word 'arnes' meaning armor 
    but it was also interchangeably used to mean weapon. And lastly, Eskrima is from the Spanish word 'esgrima' meaning fencing which also 
    cognates with the French word 'escrime' meaning skirmish.</p>
<p>Kali Arnis is the ancient way our ancestors, specifically "Pintados", were fighting, and apparently it was so effective that the only thing that stopped
    them is firearms.
