<h2>Silat</h2>
<p>Silat is the collective term for indigenous martial arts from the Nusantra and 
 it's surrounding geo-cultural areas in Southeast Asia.  There are hundreds of different styles 
 and schools which tend to focus either on strikes, joint manipulation, weaponry, or some combination 
 thereof. It is officially called Pencak Silat in Indonesia, Silat in the Philippines, dika or padik 
Southern Thailand, and gayong or gayung in parts of Sumatra, Singapore, and Malaysia.</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The word 'silat' has no proper origins but it may mean weapon in Arabic coming from the word 
'silah', it can also be from the word 'sekilat' meaning 'as fast as lightning' from Malaysia.</p>
<p>a number of stories have been said regarding the origin of Silat. The most common story is that a woman named
    'Rama Sukuna' witnessed a hawk and a tiger fighting, imitating their movements she was able to fight off drunkards
    that were attacking on her. She then taught it to her husband where it was then passed down. There may be variations
    depending on the region it is told, like instead of a hawk and a tiger, it was monkeys fighting each other or a monkey and a tiger.
 There is also another story where a woman named 'Teemoh' while bathing was being interrupted by canaries and she tries to wave them. 
 Her husband was and he was angry that she was taking too long to bath, so he was gonna beat her with a stick. Teemoh doing the same waving motions
against her husband then successfully incapacityated him.</p>
